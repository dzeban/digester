Add habrahabr site handler
--------------------------

Site handler content generation
-------------------------------

Move from fixed template for all sites to site-local content generation

  For example, reddit links might be with site names like on reddit itself
  * Some very clever link (nytimes.com)

Simple web site
---------------

Create simple website at ribbo.net. It must have:

* Users - registration, login
* Configure subscriptions
* Previous digest pages (see "HTML page" item)
 
HTML page
---------

Create page for digest and provide link to in email.

"View on ribbo.net" that will point to

http://ribbo.net/digest/fa247e88847bd1a077a378f8607ba83dea329e9f4adffb0c33c5012abb8c039f

where the long line is the sha256 hash of the digest mail. So 2 users may view
the same page if their subscriptions are identical.

It will be stored in DB as is.
